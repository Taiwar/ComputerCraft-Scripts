A collection of Lua scripts for the ComputerCraft- and CC-Tweaked- Mods for Minecraft.
Scripts are categorized in folders based on

* The mod they're written for (`ComputerCraft (cc)` or `CC-Tweaked`)
* The **entity** they're written for (`computer`, `turtle`...)
* Whether they are considered **libraries** (`lib`)

## Running the scripts
Scripts are in different stages of being developed, but newer ones will have their requirements in a comment-header-block
in the file itself or, if part of a project, in a `README.md` in that folder.

## Disclaimer
Currently, I am making no commitment towards maintaining any of the scripts in this repository, so there are no
guarantees concerning the quality and completeness of the scripts or in what versions of the mods they will work.

Feel free to fork and/or modify and release any of them yourself, as long as you comply with the license (GPL v3).
